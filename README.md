# HybridCite
This is an online citation recommender system designed as a Flask app. It uses data from the Microsoft Academic Graph data set and a hybrid 'semi-genetic' algorithm based on HyperDoc2Vec and BM25. 
For more details, see the new official repo which contains more than just the Flask app: https://github.com/ashwath92/HybridCite/.
